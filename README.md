# Car-Dheko-Used-Car-Price-Prediction
## Domain:
- Automotive Industry
- Data Science
- Machine Learning
## Introduction:
              In this project, the goal is to enhance the customer experience and optimize the pricing process for used cars by developing a machine learning model. This model, trained on historical car price data, considers various features such as the car's make, model, year, fuel type, and transmission type. The ultimate aim is to accurately predict the prices of used cars and integrate this model into an interactive web application using Streamlit.

## Features:
- **Car Price Prediction**: Predict the price of a used car based on its features like make, model, year, fuel type, transmission type, and more.
- **Interactive Web App**: Streamlit app to deliver quick and reliable price estimates for users.
## Skills Gained:
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, outlier detection, feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the data distribution, identifying patterns, and visualizing relationships between variables.
- **Machine Learning Model Development**: Using regression models to predict car prices.
- **Price Prediction Techniques**: Implementing algorithms like Random Forest, Linear Regression, etc., for accurate price predictions.
- **Model Evaluation and Optimization**: Evaluating model performance using metrics like R², Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using techniques like Grid Search for optimizing model parameters.
- **Streamlit Application Development**: Building an interactive web app to deploy the machine learning model.
- **Documentation and Reporting**: Creating clear and concise documentation of the entire project workflow.
## Results:
- The **Random Forest Regressor** achieved the best performance, with the highest R² score and the lowest MSE/MAE, making it the chosen model for deployment.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Used **Grid Search** to optimize the model's hyperparameters (e.g., n_estimators, max_depth). This process significantly improved the model's performance by systematically testing a range of values for these parameters.
## Streamlit Application Development:
- **Deployment**: The predictive model has been deployed through a **Streamlit** application, providing a user-friendly interface for users to quickly estimate the price of used cars based on the input features.
- **Impact**: This integration has revolutionized the user experience at **CarDekho**, making it easy for users to get reliable price estimates for used cars.
## Project Workflow:
- **Data Collection**: Gathered historical car price data from reliable sources.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and preprocessed the data, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- **Model Training**: Trained multiple machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Linear Regression) to predict car prices.
- **Model Evaluation**: Used metrics like R², MSE, and MAE to evaluate model performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Employed Grid Search to optimize the model's hyperparameters.
- **Model Deployment**: Deployed the best-performing model using Streamlit for an interactive user experience.
- **Documentation**: Documented the steps, analysis, and results for transparency.
